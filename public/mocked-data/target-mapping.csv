OR1A1,Olfactory,Activation,"Cell-based olfactory receptor assay (HEK293, cAMP or Ca2+ readout)",EC50,"OR1A1 responds to soft, pleasant odorants. Moderate activation supports smooth, familiar odor perception linked to reduced emotional arousal.",,N/A
OR2J3,Olfactory,Activation,Heterologous OR expression assay with reporter gene,EC50,OR2J3 is associated with fresh/green odor notes. Balanced activation contributes to emotional lightness without overstimulation.,,N/A
TRPM8,Trigeminal,Activation,Calcium influx assay (TRPM8-expressing cells),EC50,Gentle TRPM8 engagement produces cooling and freshness that can bias autonomic tone toward relaxation when intensity is controlled.,https://files.rcsb.org/download/8BDC.pdb,CHEMBL1075319
TRPV3,Trigeminal,Sub-threshold modulation,Calcium influx inhibition assay,IC50,TRPV3 contributes to warmth and comfort cues. Mild modulation supports safety and coziness rather than alertness.,https://files.rcsb.org/download/6H9J.pdb,CHEMBL5522
