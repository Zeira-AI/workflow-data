Protein target,Biological system,Desired modulation,Corresponding assay,Metric used,Rationale for calming association,Crystalized structure available?,ChemBL ID
OR1A1,Olfactory,Mild–moderate activation,"Cell-based olfactory receptor assay (HEK293, cAMP or Ca²? readout)",EC50,"OR1A1 responds to soft, pleasant odorants. Moderate activation supports smooth, familiar odor perception linked to reduced emotional arousal.",N/A,N/A
OR2J3,Olfactory,Balanced activation (avoid saturation),Heterologous OR expression assay with reporter gene,EC50,OR2J3 is associated with fresh/green odor notes. Balanced activation contributes to emotional lightness without overstimulation.,N/A,N/A
TRPM8,Trigeminal,Low-level activation,Calcium influx assay (TRPM8-expressing cells),EC50,Gentle TRPM8 engagement produces cooling and freshness that can bias autonomic tone toward relaxation when intensity is controlled.,YES,CHEMBL1075319
TRPV3,Trigeminal,Sub-threshold modulation,Calcium influx inhibition assay,IC50,TRPV3 contributes to warmth and comfort cues. Mild modulation supports safety and coziness rather than alertness.,YES,CHEMBL5522
