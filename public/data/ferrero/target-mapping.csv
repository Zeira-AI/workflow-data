TAS2R14,Gustatory (bitter taste GPCR),Strong agonism,Cell-based TAS2R Ca²⁺ flux assay (HEK293 + Gα16),EC50,"Broadly tuned bitter receptor; strong activation produces an instinctive ""poison"" response, especially pronounced in children.",YES,CHEMBL3309105
TAS2R38,Gustatory (bitter taste GPCR),Strong agonism,Ca²⁺ mobilization assay,EC50,Highly correlated with bitterness sensitivity; activation reliably causes rejection even at very low exposure.,NO,CHEMBL4523248
TRPA1,Trigeminal (irritant sensor),"Brief, low-dose activation",Calcium influx assay (electrophilic agonists),EC50,"Produces sharp, unpleasant oral sensation (sting/irritation) without heat; effective at triggering immediate withdrawal.",YES,CHEMBL6007
TRPV1,Trigeminal (heat/pungency),Sub-threshold activation,Capsaicin-like Ca²⁺ influx assay,EC50,Mild pungency reinforces aversion but must remain below pain or panic thresholds for child safety.,YES,CHEMBL4794
